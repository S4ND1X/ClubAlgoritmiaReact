This project contains environment variables so inside you folder create a new file named:

    index.js

## Next features
This Web App is still in development, maybe for the next 3 months. The future features are the following:

 - Eventbrite API for fetching workshops data and so we can turn Eventbrite the central dashboard
 - Youtube API for fetching data from this [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD_B4-slyYz-qYK7BI6R4oA) in order to display workshops recorded sessions inside the page.
 - Github Scrapping to get members profile info.(Easier for what I need than Github API)
 - Have a section for all of the bootcampers to upload their project and make a community project gallery.
 - Implement NextJS to enable server side rendering (Important if we want to scale it)
